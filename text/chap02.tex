bed, several chairs, and an old deal desk he'd just left, confident in
the action of moderating powers, to ease his mind of some congested thoughts. He
looked at his watch which he kept hung on a nail. The afternoon was to have been
spent, as the morning had, writing, but something else was on his mind.

  There was an unfinished manuscript, tentatively called \textit{Rumpopulorum}, 
spread out there, a curious, if speculative, examination of the world of angels,
archistrateges, 
\mynote{archistratege}{(n.): \textdbend \textit{archi}+\textit{stratege},

with the additions that overheated his prose and yet brought it all to test.

  The human skull, his pencils in its noseholes, that had been ritually placed
on that desk a week previous ---his first days in the South --- seemed appropriate to
his life, a reminder, mysteriously elate,

condition: Exalted, lofty. Of feelings, etc.: Lofty, proud.}
of what actually wasn't, something
there but not, a memory of man without one, for not only had he more or less
withdrawn from the world, long a characteristic of the d'Arconvilles, but the
caricatures of mortal vanity 
\mynote{vanity}{(n.): that which is vain, futile, or worthless; that which is
of no value or profit.}
were as necessary to his point of view as the unction 
\mynote{unction}{(n.): that quality in language, address, or the like, which 
excites emotion; especially, strong devotion; religious fervor and tenderness; 
sometimes, a simulated, factitious, or unnatural fervor.

of religious conventionality was featureless.

  Darconville's cat leaped onto the windowsill and peered up, as if collating
\mynote{collate}{(v.): to assemble in proper sequence}
the thoughts of his master: where were they? How had they come to be here? What
reason, in fact, had they to be in this strange place? The young man, however,
continued leaning by the window and reviewing what he saw. But there was another
view, for behind it, or perhaps beyond somewhere, in vague, half-blind
remembrances of wherever he'd been --- sources of endless pleasure to him 
--- he dwelled awhile to find himself, looking back in time, surprised at the 
absence in it of
any figure but his own. He felt no particular responsibility to memory but
accepted his dreams, to which, living altogether as a twin self in the depths of
him, he could speak in inviolable secrecy.

  It had long seemed clear, commandmental: to seek out a relatively distant and
unembellished 
\mynote{unembellished}{(adj.): lacking emellishment or ornamentation}
part of the world where, in the solitude he arranged for
himself ---rather like the pilgrim who lives on lentils, 
\mynote{lentil}{(n.): a type of flat, round seed that is related to the pea 
and is eaten as a vegetable}
pulses, 
\mynote{pulse}{(n.): the edible seeds of various crops (as peas, beans, or 
lentils) of the legume family.}
and the tested modes of self-denial --- one might apply himself to those deeper 
mysteries where nameless somethings in their causes slept. He sought the obol 
\mynote{obol}{(n.): =obolus, a silver (in later times bronze) coin of ancient 
Greece, of the value of 1/6 of a drachma. }

\footnote{大黑天, Japanese god of great darkness or balckness, or the god of

the lamp of Aladdin. There were difficulties, often, in the
way of carrying out his plans. But he overbore them and, hoping to fall prey to
neither fascination nor fatigue, sought only to stem distraction, to learn the
secrets beyond the world he felt belonged to him, and to write. It was the
Beatitude 
\mynote{beatitude}{(n.): Felicity of the highest kind; consummate bliss.}

which showed less of mature
steadiness than innocent deliberation, an expensive coloring backlit with a kind
of intangible grace, and his eyes, of a strange tragic beauty, dark and filled
with studying what's represented by what is, could light up like a monk at
jubilee 
\mynote{jubilee}{(n.): In Judaism and Christianity, the concept of the Jubilee 
is a special year of remission of sins and universal pardon. In the Book of 
Leviticus, a Jubilee year (Hebrew: \cardo{יובל‎‎ yūḇāl}) is mentioned to occur every
fiftieth year, during which slaves and prisoners would be freed, debts would be
forgiven and the mercies of God would be particularly manifest.
In Western Christianity, the tradition dates to 1300, when Pope Boniface VIII
convoked a holy year, following which ordinary jubilees have generally been
celebrated every 25 or 50 years; with extraordinary jubilees in addition
depending on need. Christian Jubilees, particularly in the Latin Church,
generally involve pilgrimage to a sacred site, normally the city of Rome.

He dreamed, like Astrophel, 
\footnote{Probably intended to mean "star lover", from Greek ἄστρο-ν star 
and ϕίλος lover, friend. This name was first used by the 16th-century poet 
Sir Philip Sidney in his collection of sonnets \textit{Astrophel and Stella}.
}
with his head in the stars. His mind was like one of those Gothic 
cathedrals of which he was so fond,
mysterious within, and filled with light, a brightness at once richer and less
real than the light of day, flashing accompaniment, on occasion, to the long
satirical tirades 
\mynote{tirade}{(n.): a long, angry, or violent speech. A volley of words; a long and
vehement speech on some subject; a declamation; a protracted harangue, esp. of
denunciation, abuse, or invective. 
}
of which he was also capable and yet wakefully aware, in
gentleness, of what in matters of difficulty he felt should either be removed,
pitied, or understood. He was six feet tall. His hair he wore long, like the
Renaissance prince at his lyre, and it matched in color his coat of jet which
was of an obsolete but distinct cut and as black as the mundus

\mynote{commune}{(v.): to converse together with sympathy
and confidence; to interchange sentiments or feelings; to take counsel.}

  The book he was working on --- a grimoire,

correctness or elegance.}
away in the light of his gooseneck lamp that not
only left the rest of the room in darkness but at such times rendered
insignificant any matters of consequence beyond that. There was a private
quality about him as he worked: a wizard in conical

\mynote{sext}{(n): Sext, or Sixth Hour, is a fixed time of prayer of the Divine 
Office of almost all the traditional Christian liturgies. It consists mainly 
of psalms and is said at noon. Its name comes from Latin and refers to the 
sixth hour of the day after dawn. }

who introduces Can to Ought. He crafted his writing and loved listening to 
those tiny explosions when the active brutality of verbs in revolution raced 
into sweet established nouns to send marching across the page a newly 
commissioned army of words-on-maneuvers, all decorated in loops, frets, 
\mynote{fret}{(n.): an ornament or ornamental work often in relief consisting of small
straight bars intersecting one another in right or oblique angles.

and arrowlike flourishes.
\mynote{flourish}{(n.): a florid decoration; a piece of scroll-work, tracery,

Darconville was bedeviled by angels: they stalked and leaguered him by night and
day, and, when sitting at his desk, he never failed to acknowledge Stimulator,
the angel invoked in the exorcism 
\mynote{exorcism}{(n.): the action of exorcizing or expelling an evil spirit 
by adjuration or the performance of certain rites; an instance of this. From late L.

no less of the supernatural than Creation itself.
Was doubt the knot in faith's muscle? And yet faith required to fill the desert
places of an empty page? Then this was a day in September no different from any
others on which he wrote, the mind making up madness, the hand its little
prattboy 
\footnote{Threoux's coinage. \textit{prat} means a trick; a piece of
trickery or fraud; a prank, a frolic. }
hopping along after it to record what it could of measure --- but there was
one exception.

  Darconville anxiously kept seeing the face of one of his students, someone he
had noticed on the first day of class. She was a freshman. He didn't know her
name.

  He might have spent an inattentive afternoon in consequence but, subdued by
what had no charm for him, instead vexed 
\mynote{vex}{(v.): to make angry or annoyed by little provocations; to 
irritate; to plague; to torment; to harass; to afflict; to trouble; to tease.
}
himself to write as a means of serving
notice to a mischief he'd been uncertain of now for too many days. Beauty, while
it haunted him, also distracted him; unable to resist its appeal, he, however,
longed to be above it. There is a will so strong as to recoil upon itself and
fall into indecision: a deliberate person's, often, who, otherwise prompt to
action, sometimes leaves everything undone --- or, better, assumes that 
whatever has
been done is something already charged to an appointed end, relieving him then
of calling into question by subsequent thought the meaning of its worth. Did
Darconville's mind, then, obsessed and overwhelmed by images and dreams of the
supernatural, crave at last for the one thing stranger than all these --- the
experience of it in fact? It is perhaps easy to believe so.

  He was born --- of French and Italian parentage --- on the reaches of coastal New
England where the old Victorian house that was the family seat stands to this
day in a small village hard by the sea. It was always a region of spectacular
beauty, infinite skies and meadows and ocean, and all aspects of nature there
seemed drawn together in a tie of inexpressible benediction. His youthful dreams
were always of a supernatural cast, shot through with vision, and nothing
whatsoever matter-of-fact could avail against the propagation of his early
romantic ideals. It had been instilled in him early --- his Venetian grandmother
fairly threw her hands over her ears at the suggestion of any aspiration less
noble --- that the goal of a person's life must naturally afford the light by which
the rest of it should be read, a doctrine that paradoxically created in him less
a strength against than a disposition to a belief in unreal worlds, a condition
somehow making him particularly unsuited for the heartache of real life.

  The facts of one's childhood are always important when touching on a genius.
Darconville was an ardently religious boy, much attracted to ritual. At six, he
won the school ribbon for a drawing of the face of God --- it resembled a cat's
--- and illustrated a juvenile book of his own dramatic making which ended: 
"But wait, there is something coming toward me ---!" There were illnesses, and 
a double pneumonia in childhood following a nearly fatal bout with measles 
\mynote{measle}{(n.): an infectious viral disease causing fever and a red 
rash on the skin, typically occurring in childhood.}
left his lungs imperfect. He would never forget his father who read to 
him or his mother who kissed him goodnight, for he lost both of them before 
he was fourteen, whereupon, becoming wayward 
\mynote{wayward}{(adj.): taking one's own way; disobedient; froward; 
perverse; willful.}
and discontented with everything else, he cut short
his schooling to join the Franciscan Order, less on the advice growing out of
the newly assumed regency of his grandmother, though that, than on the
investigation of a dream: a nostalgia 
\mynote{nostalgia}{(n.): regret or sorrowful longing for the conditions of a 
past age; regretful or wistful memory or recall of an earlier time. From mod.L.
\textit{nostalgia}(so It., Sp., Pg.; F. \textit{nostalgie} (1802)), from 
Gr. νόστος return home + ἄλγος pain.}
for vision, if commonly absent in others, then not so for a little boy 
whose earliest memory was of trying to pick up pieces of moonlight that had 
fallen through the window onto his bed.

  Seminary life in those early years led to strange and unaccountable antipathies. 
\mynote{antipathy}{(n.): strong feeling of dislike.}
It was not that he didn't feel he fit, but if particulars went
well --- in everything, save, perhaps, for the occasional youthful temptation he
suffered during lectio 
\mynote{lectio}{(n.): Latin for reading.}
divina while reading Lucretius 
\footnote{Titus Lucretius Carus (c. 99 BC -- c. 55 BC) was
a Roman poet and philosopher. His only known work is the epic philosophical poem
\textit{De rerum natura} about the tenets and philosophy of Epicureanism, and which is
usually translated into English as \textit{On the Nature of Things}.

on the terminology of physical love --- general acceptance came hard. He improvised

midnight, claimed he could work curses, and put it about that he believed
animals, because of a universal language from which we alone had fallen, could
understand us when we spoke. He astonished his fellow students, furthermore,
with several rapturous 
\mynote{rapturous}{(adj.): Ecstatic; transporting; ravishing; feeling, expressing, or 
		manifesting rapture; as, “rapturous joy, pleasure, or delight; rapturous applause.”}
edificial schemes few shared: to rebuild the tomb of St.
John at Ephesus; 
to set up birdhouses for Christ through upstate New York; and
to reconstruct --- he actually stepped off the dimensions on the ballfield and began
to assemble planks 
\mynote{plank}{(n.): A long flat piece of smoothed timber, thicker than a board.} 
--- Noah's Ark. Throughout these years he showed a splendid but
innocent sense of fun.

  Darconville owned a great fat pen he called "The Black Disaster" --- an object,
he demoted, no other hand dare touch! His classmates were solemnly,
ceremoniously, assured it was magic, and it was coveted by all of them only in
so far as stealing it might render its owner a less vivid, if not less
bumptious, 
\mynote{bumptious}{(adj.): obtrusively pushy; self-assertive to a pretentious extreme.}
antagonist. He managed never to relinquish 
\mynote{relinquish}{(v.): let go}
it, however, and drew angels all over his copybooks; wrote squibs 
\mynote{squib}{(n.): a sarcastic speech or publication; a petty lampoon; 
a brief, witty essay.}
about some of his colleagues which,
signed "Aenigmaticus," he secretly distributed in various library books; and one
day, for drawing a fresco --- his capolavoro

but undisguisedly, bore the face of one of the college prefects, 
\mynote{prefect}{(n.): a chief officer or chief magistrate.}
he was slapped so
hard by a certain Father Theophane that it effected a stammer in him that would
be activated, during moments of confrontation, for the rest of his life.
Hostility eventually built up, and his unconventional conduct became the subject
of such unfavorable comment in the college that it was suggested he leave. A few
defended him. (He believed it was because there had once been a cardinal in his
family, as indeed there had been.) The rest, some silently abusive, naggingly
malevolent, or outright vindictive, more or less concurred in the bizarre if
hard to be seriously taken fiat 
\mynote{fiat}{(n.): an authoritative command or order to do something; 
an effectual decree.}

objections.

  As it happened, he never attained to the priesthood ---not, however, because he
didn't again try. For try again he did, but failed once more. And yet with what
reckless audacity, 
\mynote{audacity}{(n.): boldness, daring, intrepidity; confidence. }
with what fierce, uncompromising passion did he always charge
and fight and charge again! Resignation to appointed ends? He was not of an age
for that. And as there hovered

resigning the soul to the pleasures and idle conveniences of the world, his 
aspirations,

individual and metaphysical, led abruptly to another decision. He
entered a Trappist

his charity on the spot. Dismal
depression followed. He received the blessing of the Abbot, who repeated the
famous words of the old desert fathers: "fuge, tace, et quiesce" 
\footnote{Latin for "Flee, be silent, rest".}
and, leaving the following day in an egg truck --- with one suitcase, a great 
fat pen, and all his limitations --- went bouncing over the hill in the direction 
of the declining sunshine.

  At twenty, in what was probably the climactic event of his life, Darconville
discovered writing, the sole subject of his curiosity at this time being words
and the possibility of giving expression to them. Now, among those fragile loves
to which most men look back with tenderness and passion, certain must be singled
out as of special importance: in young Darconville's life it was to be his proud
and irrepressible grandmama whose affection for him was always on the increase
and who --- never once having failed to give fortitude to his individuality,
although in quaint

time having some attractive or agreeable feature, esp., having an old-fashioned 
prettiness or daintiness. }

of which he followed. Did he want to write? she had asked and upon
the instant answered Darconville, who had but to follow the direction of her

  It wasn't long before his grandmother passed away. The palazzo, immediately

for the clerical years, he took her cat, Spellvexit ---his sole companion
now ---and set sail back to the United States, looking once more for the
possibilities of the possible as possible. The spirit of his youthful dreams,
long, strangely enough, having retarded his purposes rather than advancing them,
he studiedly

refused to renounce: of justice and fair play, of living instead of
dying, of loving instead of hating. Single virtue, he always believed, was proof
against manifold vice. And yet all the caprices 
\mynote{caprice}{(n.): a sudden change or turn of the mind without apparent or adequate
motive; a desire or opinion arbitrarily or fantastically formed; a freak, whim,
mere fancy.}
and aspects of human life that
gratified curiosity and excited surprise in him continued only as incidents on
the way to Glory.

  Darconville ---wherever ---quite happily chose to live within his own world, 
within his own writing, within himself. The thickest, most permanent wall 
dividing him from his fellow creatures was that of mediocrity. His particular 
sensibility forbade him to accept unquestioned society's rules and taboos, 
its situational standards and ethics, syntheses that to him always seemed 
either too exclusive or too inclusive. His domineering 
\mynote{domineering}{(adj.): Ruling arbitrarily or imperiously; tyrannical, 
despotic; overbearing, insolent.}
sense of right, as sometimes only he saw it,
and his ardent desire to keep to the fastness 
\mynote{fastness}{(n.): The quality or state of being firmly fixed; fixedness, stability. }
of his own destiny, set him apart in several ways. Reclusive, 
\mynote{reclusive}{(adj.): marked by reclusion or retirement.}
he shrank from all avoidable company with others ---it was the prerogative 
\mynote{prerogative}{(n.): prior, exclusive, or peculiar right or privilege}
of his faith to recognize, and of his character to
overpower, objection here ---and chose to believe only that somewhere, perhaps on
the footing of schoolmaster, he could inoffensively foster 
\mynote{foster}{(v.): To supply with food or nourishment; to nourish, feed, support.}
sums, if modest, then
at least sufficient to allow him the time to write. He sought the land of
Nusquamia, a place broadly mapped out in James 4:4, and whether by chance or
perchance 
\mynote{perchance}{(adv.): by chance, maybe}
by intention one day, wasting no time balancing or inquiring, he
selected a school for the purpose, was hired, and disappeared again into the
arcane.

It didn't really have to have a name. In fact, however, it did. It was a
town in Virginia, called Quinsyburg.

that left its echo behind like the passing tribute of a sigh. And Darconville, 
while yet amply occupied, was by no means so derogate 
\mynote{derogate}{(adj.): annulled or abrogated in part; lessened in authority, force,
estimation, etc.}
from the common run of human emotions as not to share, upon hearing
it ---Spellvexit always looked up ---a derivative feeling of loneliness, a

by the bleakness of the place upon which it settled. The town was the quotidian

\mynote{limbo}{(n.): any unfavourable place or condition, likened to Limbo; esp. a
condition of neglect or oblivion to which persons or things are consigned when
regarded as outworn, useless, or absurd. 
}
there was no suddenness, no irresistibility, no velocity
of extraordinary acts. He found hours and hours of complete solitude there,
however, and that became the source, as he wrote, not of oppressive
exclusiveness but of organizing anticipations he could accommodate in his work:
the mystic's rapture 
\mynote{rapture}{(n.): a strong fit or attack of (some emotion or mental state).}
at feeling his phantom self. He had assumed this exile not
with the destitution of spirit the prodigal

from any aristocratic weariness a previous life in foreign parts might have
induced, but rather to pull the plug of consequence from the sump

\mynote{toil}{(n.): severe labour; hard and continuous work or exertion which taxes the
bodily or mental powers.  }
and the bald indices of failure and success became irrelevant. The man
beyond the context of hope is equally beyond the context of despair, and the
serious vow Darconville had once made to himself, medievally sworn in the old
ipsedixitist 
\mynote{ipsedixitist}{(n.):  From \textit{ipse dixit},a translation of Gr. 
αὐτὸς ἔϕα `he himself (the master) said it', a phrase used by the Pythagoreans, 
thus means an unproved assertion resting on the bare authority of some speaker;
a dogmatic statement; a dictum.

us, was to look beyond it. Darconville was below
envy and above want. And what pleasures a place denied to the sight, he hoped,
were given necessarily to the imagination. He sought the broom of Eucrates, 
the sword of Fragarach, 
\footnote{ In Irish mythology, Fragarach (or Freagarthach), known as 'The
Answerer' or 'The Retaliator', was the sword of Manannan mac Lir and later, Lugh
Lamfada. Forged by the gods, Manannan wielded it as his weapon before passing 
it on to Lugh (his foster son). It was given to Cúchulainn by Lugh, and later 
to Conn of the Hundred Battles. It was said that no one could tell a lie or 
move, with Fragarach at his or her throat, thus the name 'Answerer'. It was 
also said to place the wind at the user's command and could cut through any 
shield or wall, and had a piercing wound from which no man could recover.

Prosperity, furthermore, had perhaps
killed more than adversity, an observance fortified in him by what was not only
the d'Arconville motto but also his grandmother's most often repeated if
somewhat overly enthusiastic febrifuge: 
\mynote{febrifuge}{(n.): A medicine adapted to drive away or to reduce fever; 
hence, a cooling drink. From F. fébrifuge, f. (on L. type *febrifugus) L. febri-, 
febris fever + fug-āre to drive away.

"Un altro, un altro, gran' Dio, ma più forte!" And so he had come to this 
plutonial grey area, a neglected spot, where
passersby didn't look for art to happen as it might and when it would ---to lose
himself for good, in both senses, and realize the apocalypse 
\mynote{apocalypse}{(n.): The 'revelation' of the future granted to St. John in the isle of
Patmos. Thus by extension: any revelation or disclosure.  
}
that is incomprehensible without Patmos.

in the Aegean Sea, most famous for being the location of both the vision of

  It had grown dark.

  Darconville had finished a day's writing, took some cigarettes from his
suitcase, still as yet unpacked, and walked through the disheveled

piece of fruit, esp. an orange, stuck with cloves and usu. tied with ribbon,
which is hung or placed in a wardrobe.  Cloves can be used to make a fragrance pomander 
when combined with an orange. When given as a gift in Victorian England, such a 
pomander indicated warmth of feeling.

accompanying card out of its tiny envelope. It read simply: "For the fairest."

  They were the three words that had started the Trojan War.
